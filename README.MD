# Fisco

WORK IN PROGRESS

Fisco is a DSL built for automatic data extraction from documents stored as images and performing operations on it.

It was created in Python, using Lark as a parsing toolkit.

All functions for data aggregation are already implemented. The part for data extraction works separately and can be found [here](https://github.com/senpainikolay/PBL-DSL/tree/main/DataExtraction), but not yet integrated in the DSL since extracting data is a complicated process if done properly and needs some more work.
